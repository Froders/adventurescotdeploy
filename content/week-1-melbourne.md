Welcome to our first week round up! Here a quick glance on what we've been up to.

**Accommodation**

We've been staying in a big shared house deep in the suburbs of Melbourne.

We're staying a street away from a 6 lane stroad and near to some car-centric big box stores. We're both from Europe so this has been quite a shock to us. We're a bit worried that Australia is car centric.

One on plus side we have been living right beside a tram line, which I always have a sweet spot for trams. It is an hour to the Central Business District (CBD) which is a bit too far.

**What we've been up to**

Salme comes from a trampolining background so we were trying to find a trampoline park. One lady on our flight recommended BounceInc which we have been visiting in Glen Iris. It is a lovely big trampoline centre, with every kind of trampolining you would want in it. On top of that it even has a ninja warrior course, with a parkour area, which is equal to easy and hard.

We've also been visiting the CBD and exploring round the shopping centres including going to an AUD$8.50 all you can eat eat. Which I thought was well worth it, while Salme thought it was a bit dodgy.

While we were down there we also visited the Lego store which has a beautiful recreation of Yamma Tram. Plus on one of the days we went Fun-Lab was having a fundraiser for Headspace. Meaning that we go some cheap bowling and laser tag while supporting a charity.

Lastly we visited St Kilda beach which has a model of the universe along the coastal walk and a great little skatepark which has a webcam so you can view it 24 hours a day. Additionally it has some beautiful sunsets.
